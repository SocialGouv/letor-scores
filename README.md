# letor-scores

JavaScript port of https://github.com/ArmandGiraud/letor_scores

## Usage

```js
const { mrr, dcg, precisionK, recall } = require("@socialgouv/letor-scores");

const predictions = ["a", "b", "c"];
const expected = ["b", "e"];
const expectedScoresDict = { b: 5, e: 1 };

console.log({
  mrr: mrr({
    predictions,
    expected
  }),
  dcg: dcg({
    predictions,
    expectedScores: expectedScoresDict,
    k
  }),
  precision: precisionK({
    predictions,
    expected,
    k
  }),
  recall: recall({
    predictions,
    expected,
    k
  })
});
```

## Dev

Install yarn : `npm i -g yarn`

Then launch tests with `yarn test`

```
 PASS  src/dcg.test.js
  ✓ emptyPrediction return 0 (5ms)
  ✓ badPrediction1 return 0 (1ms)
  ✓ more documents in predictions should not alter dcg
  ✓ better prediction should have higher score (1ms)
  ✓ higher k doesnt crash (1ms)
  ✓ ideal dcg is computed correctly: normalization makes effect
  ✓ dcg relative scores (1ms)
  ✓ dcg is not messed by additional results
  ✓ one good result on first place should be ideal (1ms)
